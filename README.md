# Vessel Forecasting

Video link: https://youtu.be/qI7d_-VsyHU

Needs/Goals:

- To streamline the process of updating vessel loading forecasts between offices from different regions.

Frustrations/Pain points:

- Having information that is out of date and/or inaccurate to make decisions.
- Forgetting to chase for updates on loadings from other ports.
- Forgetting that a vessel arriving soon at port of load.

Problem Statement:

- Vessels typically have routes that span multiple countries, and each country has their own method of reporting their total loadings on a vessel.
- This project is done with the aim of having a common platform for all regions to use and to update their loadings, so other regions are able to see the loadings in real time and to react accordingly (to top-up or to trim their cargoes).

Solution Statement:

- By providing a web portal that consolidates all information of vessels and loadings at each port, each user will be able to accurately determine the appropriate course of action to take.
- By having 1 database, information shared across all end-users will be the same.

User Stories:

- The user would want to see at-a-glance the arrival / departure time for all approaching vessels.
- Based on the number of vessels approaching the port, the user would have the knowledge to plan cargoes accordingly.
